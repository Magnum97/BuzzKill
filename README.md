#### A mob manager for Minecraft servers

I wrote this to encourage my son to upgrade his server, as he is quote afraid of bees. After using it I had the idea to expand it to manage other mobs, and do so selectively and give owners full control over what spawns in their world.

If this helps you or teaches you anything please leave a star. If you build on this idea I would love to see what you add, and possibly integrate it.
